Clicky Game
About the Game
This a simple memory game created with React. The purpose of this app to practice how an application's UI is broken up into components, managing component state, and responding to user events.

How it works
The application renders a dozen different images of differnt wild animals to the screen.

When the user clicks on an image, the user gets points and the images are shuffled. The the user is asked to click on an image only once. 

The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is incremented

If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is reset to 0.

The application keeps track of the users Best Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Best Score.
